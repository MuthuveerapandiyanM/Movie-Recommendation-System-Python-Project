# Movie-Recommendation-System-Python-Project

## Objective
The recommendation system analyzes the preferences of the user concerned, and then it uses this information to try to find similar movies.After that, the system provides movie recommendations for the user. 
## Designing our Movie Recommendation System
To obtain recommendations for our users, we will predict their ratings for movies they havenâ€™t watched yet. Movies are then indexed and suggested to users based on these predicted ratings.
